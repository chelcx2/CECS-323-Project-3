# MongoDB-Theater-Enterprise
 This is a NoSQL project based on a Theater enterprise.


In this project, I translated a UML solution into MongoDB collections, using JSON schema documents. I eveloped JSON documents to represent several theater, film, and showing documents. I then developed a JSON Schema for a collection of actors who are the "stars" of the films in the database, choosing Mongo-appropriate ways to represent the relationship between films and their starring actors. I then wrote a few simple MongoDB queries using the MONGOSH shell in Compass.
